## The python code library for Fredrik Gabrielsen

This is my public code library. It will primarly be used to test and get to know Git and Github better while being able to store the different code and projects I create. It only contains python code primarly in the form of Jupyter notebooks. 

### DataQuest: Data Analyst Path
